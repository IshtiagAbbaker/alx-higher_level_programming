In Python, classes and objects form the foundation of object-oriented programming (OOP), providing a powerful paradigm for organizing and structuring code. A class is a blueprint for creating objects, which are instances of that class. It encapsulates data and behavior within a single unit, allowing for code reuse, modularity, and abstraction.

In Python, defining a class involves specifying attributes (variables) and methods (functions) that describe the characteristics and actions of the objects created from the class. These attributes and methods are accessed using dot notation. Attributes store information about the object, while methods represent actions or behaviors associated with the object.

The `self` parameter in Python class methods refers to the instance of the class and allows access to its attributes and methods. During object instantiation, the `__init__` method is commonly used to initialize the object's attributes.

Python supports encapsulation, allowing the definition of public, protected, and private attributes and methods. Public attributes and methods are accessible from outside the class, while protected and private members have naming conventions (single and double underscores, respectively) to indicate their visibility scope.

Inheritance is another crucial concept, enabling the creation of new classes based on existing ones. This promotes code reuse and the establishment of hierarchies, enhancing the organization and readability of code.

Python's dynamic typing and flexibility contribute to the simplicity and expressiveness of class and object interactions. This flexibility, combined with the elegance of Python syntax, makes classes and objects a fundamental aspect of Python programming, facilitating the creation of modular, extensible, and maintainable code.
