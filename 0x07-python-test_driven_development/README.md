Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development approach that emphasizes writing tests before writing the actual code. Python, a versatile and widely used programming language, has become a popular choice for implementing TDD practices. TDD in Python involves creating automated tests that define the expected behavior of a particular piece of code before writing the code itself. Developers start by writing a test that should initially fail since the corresponding code has not been implemented. They then proceed to write the minimum amount of code necessary to make the test pass. This iterative cycle continues, with developers constantly refining both the tests and the code. Python's simplicity, readability, and extensive testing frameworks, such as unittest, pytest, and doctest, make it well-suited for TDD. The combination of Python and TDD results in more robust, maintainable, and bug-resistant code, as it encourages thorough testing and ensures that changes to the codebase are verified against predefined criteria.
