JavaScript is a dynamic and versatile programming language primarily used for creating interactive web pages. Developed in the mid-1990s by Brendan Eich, it quickly became an integral part of web development alongside HTML and CSS. JavaScript enables developers to add functionality to websites, allowing for features such as dynamic content updates, form validation, and interactive user interfaces. Its popularity has soared due to its ability to run on all major web browsers without requiring additional plugins. With the advent of frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js, JavaScript has evolved into a full-fledged ecosystem for building complex web applications and even mobile apps. Its flexibility and ubiquity make it an indispensable tool for both front-end and back-end development, cementing its place as a cornerstone of modern web development.
